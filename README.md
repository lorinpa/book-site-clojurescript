book-site-clojurescript
=======================

Sample Application - mobile client written in ClojureScript

Note! This the "Single Page" client implementation for the 
"Book Club Site" project. The dev-1.0 branch corresponds to
the Ruby on Rails server implementation located here:
(https://github.com/lorinpa/book-site-ror)

Also see [my blog article "Leveraging ClojureScript."] (http://public-action.org/mob/polyglot-leveraging-clojurescript.html)

For folks who are following my blog, I am tagging the dev-1.0 
branch as proj-v1 "Client for ROR server implementation"

Branch dev-2.0 is the client for the corresponding [book-site-jpa] (https://github.com/lorinpa/book-site-jpa) 
server implementation. The corresponding server is implemented in a stack of Java, Spring, Hibernate,
JPA, H2 database, and Jetty Web Server.
